Why?
    Here at UNCG (University at North Carolina Greensboro) we are required to secure all of our university logins using a secure password. We must also consistently update these passwords to maintain security. Having to constantly create new passwords becomes tedious and this application will help resolve that issue for me.

What does it do?
    This program gives the user a list of options to choose in order to generate the appropriate password of the users choosing. 

Why create this project?
    I want to demonstrate my understanding of the programming language java, this program uses only the language java to generate these passwords.
